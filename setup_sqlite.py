# SQLiteAuthSetup

A Python script to set up and configure SQLite for user authentication.

## Description

SQLiteAuthSetup creates a SQLite database and configures it for user registration and login functionality. It creates two tables: `users` and `user_sessions`, and sets up indexes for faster querying.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* SQLite 3.x

## Usage

1. Save this script as `setup_sqlite.py`.
2. Run the script using Python: `python setup_sqlite.py`
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process.

## Features

* Creates a SQLite database and configures it for user authentication
* Creates `users` and `user_sessions` tables
* Sets up indexes for faster querying
* Checks for SQLite and Python versions
* Displays path locations for Python and SQLite

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling for:

* SQLite connection errors
* Table creation errors
* Index creation errors

If an error occurs, the script will print an error message and exit with a non-zero status code.
